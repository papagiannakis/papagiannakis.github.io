Dr. George Papagiannakis, is a computer scientist specialised in computer graphics systems, extended reality algorithms and geometric computational models. He is co-founder and CEO of [ORamaVR](https://www.oramavr.com), a Swiss deep-tech startup that aims to accelerate the world’s transition to medical XR training. His academic credentials include serving as Professor of Computer Graphics at the [Computer Science department of the University of Crete, Greece](https://www.csd.uoc.gr/CSD/index.jsp?lang=en), as Affiliated  Research Fellow at the [Human Computer Interaction Laboratory](https://www.ics.forth.gr/hci/) of the Institute of Computer Science in the Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas, Heraklion, Greece,  where he leads the CG Group and as visiting Professor of Computer Science at the [CUI, University of Geneva, Switzerland](https://cui.unige.ch/en/).

Academic entrepreneurship work
======

ORamaVR is a Swiss, deep-tech company that seeks to transform the landscape of global healthcare. Our mission to accelerate world's transition to medical XR is destined to leverage technology to break barriers and enrich lives. ORamaVR is tackling a crucial challenge facing nearly 5 billion people worldwide: the accessibility to affordable surgical care. This issue primarily stems from an outdated medical training system that has stagnated for the past 150 years. But, like pioneering tech startup companies, we see not just problems, but opportunities for revolutionary solutions. Our response? Harnessing the transformative power of virtual and extended reality (XR) to reshape medical training.

With our innovative low-code (and soon no-code Generative AI for XR training) [MAGES-SDK](https://oramavr.com/explore-essentials/) platform, ORamaVR is democratizing the creation of high-fidelity medical VR simulations, making them more accessible and cost-effective than ever before. The influence of our award-winning platform is already evident, with the adoption by leading institutions such as USC Keck School of Medicine, NYU Langone Medical School, and the University Hospital of Geneva and Bern, among others. Testament to our remarkable vision and execution, we have garnered international recognition and built partnerships with significant industry leaders. In ORamaVR, we are  committed to push the boundaries of what is possible, to dare to think different, and to use XR technology as a canvas for realizing our most audacious dreams. The ORamaVR team is reimagining the future of medical training and opening new horizons for global healthcare and applications of spatial computing in education and training.

Academic research & teaching
======

Dr. George Papagiannakis has more than 100 publications in the field, and he is a member of CGS (Board Member), IEEE, Eurographics, ACM and SIGGRAPH professional societies. In 2011 he was awarded a Marie-Curie Intra-European Fellowship for Career Development from the European Commission’s Research Executive Agency. He was conference chair of the Computer Graphics International 2016 Conference, in cooperation with CGS, ACM, ACM SIGGRAPH and Eurographics Associations. In 2017 he published a Springer-Nature book on Mixed Reality and Gamification which achieved more than 77.000 downloads so far. His pioneering research has attracted more than 2M EUR external funding at FORTH-ICS and more than 5.5M external R&D funding at ORamaVR.

His research and development interests are centered in the field of high-fidelity interactive computer graphics systems for human computer interaction, featuring embodied presence, psychomotor learning and gamification with simulated virtual humans in extended reality based on geometric algebra computational and neural models. Research questions are driven from  computtioanl medical XR to virtual heritage, and from geometric algebra GPU  simulation, graphs and generative AI to intelligent, symbiotic extended reality systems for virtual human simulation.

Background
======

He obtained his PhD (Hons) in Computer Science from the University of Geneva, Switzerland in 2006, his M.Sc. (Hons) in Advanced Computing from the University of Bristol, UK and his B.Eng. (Hons) in Computer Systems Engineering, from the University of Manchester, UK. 
He is currently full professor at the Computer Science department of the University of Crete, Greece, associated faculty member at FORTH-ICS with the Human Computer Interaction Lab and visiting professor at the University of Geneva. Prior to this post, he had worked as lecturer, senior researcher and research assistant at MIRALab, University of Geneva with Prof. Nadia Magnenat-Thalmann. He has also held positions as lead computer graphics programmer, CTO and CEO in virtual reality simulation startups. 
In 2016 he co-founded ORamaVR, a deep-technology spatial computing medical XR training startup with the mission to accelerate world’s transition to medical extended reality. He is leading ORamaVR as co-founder and CEO today.
