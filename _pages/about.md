Dr. George Papagiannakis, is a **computer scientist** specialised in *computer graphics systems*, *extended reality algorithms* and *geometric computational models* for enhanced human-computer interaction. He is co-founder and CEO of [ORamaVR](https://www.oramavr.com), a Swiss deep-tech spatial-computing startup with the mission to accelerate the world’s transition to medical XR training. His academic credentials include *(currently on Sabbatical leave)* serving as **Professor of Computer Graphics** at the [Computer Science department of the University of Crete, Greece](https://www.csd.uoc.gr/CSD/index.jsp?lang=en), serving as **Affiliated  Research Fellow** at the [Human Computer Interaction Laboratory](https://www.ics.forth.gr/hci/) of the Institute of Computer Science in the Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas, Heraklion, Greece,  where he leads the CG Group and honorary serving as **visiting Professor** of Computer Science at the [CUI, University of Geneva, Switzerland](https://cui.unige.ch/en/).

Academic entrepreneurship
======

[ORamaVR](https://oramavr.com/about/) is a Swiss, **deep-tech spatial-computing** company that seeks to transform the landscape of global healthcare. ORamaVR's **mission** to **accelerate world's transition to medical XR training** is destined to leverage technology to break barriers and enrich lives. ORamaVR is tackling a crucial challenge facing nearly 5 billion people worldwide: [the accessibility to affordable surgical care](https://www.who.int/teams/integrated-health-services/clinical-services-and-systems/surgical-care). This issue primarily stems from an **outdated medical training system** that has stagnated for the past 150 years. But, like pioneering tech startup companies, ORamaVR sees not just problems, but opportunities for revolutionary solutions. The response? Harnessing the **transformative power of virtual and extended reality (XR)** to reshape medical training. ORamaVR commenced as a spin-off startup from [ICS-FORTH](https://ics.forth.gr) and was co-founded by Dr. George Papagianankis, [Prof. Eleftherios Tsiridis](https://tsiridis.gr) and [Prof. Panos Trahanias](https://users.ics.forth.gr/~trahania/home.html), with a massive transformational purpose.

With the most [innovative](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10038619) low-code *(and soon no-code Generative AI for XR training)* [MAGES-SDK](https://oramavr.com/explore-essentials/) platform, ORamaVR is democratizing the creation of high-fidelity medical XR simulations, making them more accessible and cost-effective than ever before. The influence of this award-winning platform is already evident, with the [adoption by leading institutions worldwide](https://oramavr.com/case-studies-testimonials/) such as USC Keck School of Medicine, NYU Langone Medical School, and the University Hospital of Geneva and Bern, among others. Testament to the remarkable vision and execution, ORamaVR has garnered [international recognition, awards](https://oramavr.com/partners-awards/) and built partnerships with significant industry leaders. In ORamaVR, all scientists, programmers and managers are committed to [push the boundaries of what is possible in science](https://oramavr.com/publications/), to dare to think different, and to use XR technology as a canvas for realizing even most audacious goals: e.g. [generative AI for computational medical XR authoring](https://oramavr.com/rd-projects/).The ORamaVR team is reimagining the future of medical training and opening [new horizons for global healthcare and applications of spatial computing](https://oramavr.com/products-2/) in education and training.

Academic research & teaching
======

Dr. George Papagiannakis has more than [120 scientific publications in the field](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rUfyI3MAAAAJ&hl=en), and he is a member of CGS, IEEE, Eurographics, ACM and SIGGRAPH professional societies. In 2011 he was **awarded the prestigious** [Marie-Curie Intra-European Fellowship for Career Development](https://cordis.europa.eu/article/id/158570-more-realistic-virtual-characters) from the European Commission’s Research Executive Agency. In 2016 he served as Conference Chair of the Computer Graphics International (CGI’16) annual conference (one of the leading and oldest computer graphics conferences) and in 2020 as programme co-chair. Under the auspices of CGI and CGS he co-founded in 2016 the ENGAGE: Empowering Novel Geometric Algebra for Graphics and Engineering Workshop, running annually ever since. In 2017 he published a Springer-Nature book on [Mixed Reality and Gamification](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-49607-8) which achieved more than 100.000 downloads so far. Since 2020 he contributes in the seminal live reference work of Springer-Nature: [Encyclopedia of Computer Graphics and Games](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-49607-8).

He enjoys [teaching](https://papagiannakis.github.io/teaching) regularly at the **Computer Science department of the University of Crete, Greece** [ranked by THE at 401-500th out of 20.000 Universities worldwide and at 94th in the Young University Rankings list](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-crete), cutting edge computer science topics such as Computer Programming, Computer Graphics and Advanced Interactive Computer Graphics at under-graduate and post-graduate level. He is currently supervising 2 post-doc, 6 PhD, 2 MSc and several BSc final year students. He has given more than 45 invited talks in companies, universities, peer-reviewed, international conferences, tutorials, summer schools worldwide. He has coordinated and led as Principal Investigator more than 25 externally funded EU and national R&D projects in Switzerland and Greece.

His research and development interests are centered in the fields of *high-fidelity interactive computer graphics systems* for human computer interaction, featuring *embodied presence, psychomotor learning and gamification with simulated virtual humans* in extended reality based on *geometric algebra computational and neural deep learning models*. Research questions are driven from **computational medical XR** and virtual heritage to **geometric algebra GPU  simulation, graphs and generative AI**, and from intelligent, symbiotic **extended reality systems** to realistic virtual human simulation. His pioneering research has attracted several international **awards and distinctions** as well as direct contribution of more than **€8M EU/Swiss/industrial funding**, disseminated in more than 50 invited/keynote talks worldwide, as shown in greater detail [here](https://papagiannakis.github.io/files/CV-GP.pdf).
