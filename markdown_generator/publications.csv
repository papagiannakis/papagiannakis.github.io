2023-04-10,"Project Elements: A computational entity-component-system in a scene-graph pythonic framework, for a neural, geometric computer graphics curriculum",Eurographics 2023 - Education Papers ,"We present the Elements project, a lightweight, open-source, computational science and computer graphics (CG) framework, tailored for educational needs, that offers, for the first time, the advantages of an Entity-Component-System (ECS) along with the rapid prototyping convenience of a Scenegraph-based pythonic framework. This novelty allows advances in the teaching of CG: from heterogeneous directed acyclic graphs and depth-first traversals, to animation, skinning, geometric algebra and shader-based components rendered via unique systems all the way to their representation as graph neural networks for 3D scientific visualization.","Papagiannakis, G., Kamarianakis, M., Protopsaltis, A., Angelis, D., Zikas, P., ""Project Elements: A computational entity-component-system in a scenegraph pythonic framework, for a neural, geometric computer graphics curriculum"", in Eurographics 2023 - Education Papers (eds.
