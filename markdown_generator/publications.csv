2023-04-10,"Project Elements: A computational entity-component-system in a scene-graph pythonic framework, for a neural, geometric computer graphics curriculum","Eurographics 2023 - Education Papers ","We present the Elements project, a lightweight, open-source, computational science and computer graphics (CG) framework, tailored for educational needs, that offers, for the first time, the advantages of an Entity-Component-System (ECS) along with the rapid prototyping convenience of a Scenegraph-based pythonic framework. This novelty allows advances in the teaching of CG: from heterogeneous directed acyclic graphs and depth-first traversals, to animation, skinning, geometric algebra and shader-based components rendered via unique systems all the way to their representation as graph neural networks for 3D scientific visualization.","Papagiannakis, G., Kamarianakis, M., Protopsaltis, A., Angelis, D., Zikas, P., ""Project Elements: A computational entity-component-system in a scenegraph pythonic framework, for a neural, geometric computer graphics curriculum"", in Eurographics 2023 - Education Papers (eds.

2014-04-20," glGA: an OpenGL Geometric Application framework for a modern, shader-based computer graphics curriculum","Eurographics 2014 - Education Papers ","This paper presents the open-source glGA (Opengl Geometric Application) framework, a lightweight, shaderbased, comprehensive and easy to understand computer graphics (CG) teaching C++ system that is used for educational purposes, with emphasis on modern graphics and GPU application programming. This framework with the accompanying examples and assignments has been employed in the last three Semesters in two different courses at the Computer Science Department of the University of Crete, Greece. It encompasses four basic Examples and six Sample Assignments for computer graphics educational purposes that support all major desktop and mobile platforms, such as Windows, Linux, MacOSX and iOS using the same code base. We argue about the extensibility of this system, referring to an outstanding postgraduate project built on top of glGA for the creation of an Augmented Reality Environment, in which life-size, virtual characters exist in a marker-less real scene. Subsequently, we present the learning results of the adoption of this CG framework by both undergraduate and postgraduate university courses as far as the success rate and student grasp of major, modern, shader-based CG topics is concerned. Finally, we summarize the novel educative features that are implemented in glGA, in comparison with other systems, as a medium for improving the teaching of modern CG and GPU application programming","Papagiannakis, G., Papanikolaou, P., Greassidou, E., and Trahanias, P., glGA: an OpenGL Geometric Application framework for a

2013-11-15,Geometric algebra rotors for skinned character animation blending,ACM SIGGRAPH Asia 2013,"The main goal and contribution of this work is to show that (automatically generated) computer implementations of geometric algebra (GA) can perform at a faster level compared to standard (dual) quaternion geometry implementations for real-time character animation blending. By this we mean that if some piece of geometry (e.g. Quaternions) is implemented through geometric algebra, the result is as efficient in terms of visual quality and even faster (in terms of computation time and memory usage) as the traditional quaternion and dual quaternion algebra implementation. This should be so even without taking into account certain algorithmic enhancements that geometric algebra may allow in selected applications. This work describes two implementation approaches for quaternion interpolation using Euclidean GA rotors for skinned character animation blending. It also lays the foundation so that GA can be employed for further calculations (skinning, rendering) under a unified geometry computation framework.","George Papagiannakis. 2013.
