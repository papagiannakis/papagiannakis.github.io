Our solution is essentially a low-code metaverse authoring platform for developers to rapidly prototype high-fidelity and high-complexity medical simulations.

With MAGES we propose an upgrade to the outdated 150-year-old masterÐapprentice medical training model. Our platform incorporates, in a nutshell, the following novelties: 1) 5G edge-cloud remote rendering and physics dissection layer, 2) realistic real-time simulation of organic tissues as soft-bodies under 10 ms, 3) a highly realistic cutting and tearing algorithm, 4) neural network assessment for user profiling and, 5) a VR recorder to record and replay or debrief the training simulation from any perspective'\n",
