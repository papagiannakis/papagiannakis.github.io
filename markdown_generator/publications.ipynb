      "2023-03-20,MAGES 4.0: Accelerating the World�s Transition to VR Training and Democratizing the Authoring of the Medical Metaverse,\"IEEE Comput. Graph. Appl. \",\"In this work, we propose MAGES 4.0, a novel software development kit to accelerate the creation of collaborative medical training applications in virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR). Our solution is essentially a low-code metaverse authoring platform for developers to rapidly prototype high-fidelity and high-complexity medical simulations. MAGES breaks the authoring boundaries across extended reality, since networked participants can also collaborate using different VR/AR as well as mobile and desktop devices, in the same metaverse world. With MAGES we propose an upgrade to the outdated 150-year-old master�apprentice medical training model. Our platform incorporates, in a nutshell, the following novelties: 1) 5G edge-cloud remote rendering and physics dissection layer, 2) realistic real-time simulation of organic tissues as soft-bodies under 10 ms, 3) a highly realistic cutting and tearing algorithm, 4) neural network assessment for user profiling and, 5) a VR recorder to record and replay or debrief the training simulation from any perspective\",\"Zikas, P., Protopsaltis, A., Lydatakis, N., Kentros, M., Geronikolakis, S., Kateros, S., Kamarianakis, M., Evangelou, G., Filippidis, A., Grigoriou, E., Angelis, D., Tamiolakis, M., Dodis, M., Kokiadis, G., Petropoulos, J., Pateraki, M., Papagiannakis, G., \"\"MAGES 4.0: Accelerating the World's Transition to VR Training and Democratizing the Authoring of the Medical Metaverse\"\", IEEE Comput.

This framework with the accompanying examples and assignments has been employed in the last three Semesters in two different courses at the Computer Science Department of the University of Crete, Greece. It encompasses four basic Examples and six Sample Assignments for computer graphics educational purposes that support all major desktop and mobile platforms, such as Windows, Linux, MacOSX and iOS using the same code base. We argue about the extensibility of this system, referring to an outstanding postgraduate project built on top of glGA for the creation of an Augmented Reality Environment, in which life-size, virtual characters exist in a marker-less real scene. Subsequently, we present the learning results of the adoption of this CG framework by both undergraduate and postgraduate university courses as far as the success rate and student grasp of major, modern, shader-based CG topics is concerned. Finally, we summarize the novel educative features that are implemented in glGA, in comparison with other systems, as a medium for improving the teaching of modern CG and GPU application programming\",\"P19.\tPapagiannakis, G., Papanikolaou, P., Greassidou, E., and Trahanias, P., glGA: an OpenGL Geometric Application framework for a \n",

      "2013-11-15,Geometric algebra rotors for skinned character animation blending,ACM SIGGRAPH Asia 2013,\"The main goal and contribution of this work is to show that (automatically generated) computer implementations of geometric algebra (GA) can perform at a faster level compared to standard (dual) quaternion geometry implementations for real-time character animation blending. By this we mean that if some piece of geometry (e.g. Quaternions) is implemented through geometric algebra, the result is as efficient in terms of visual quality and even faster (in terms of computation time and memory usage) as the traditional quaternion and dual quaternion algebra implementation. This should be so even without taking into account certain algorithmic enhancements that geometric algebra may allow in selected applications. This work describes two implementation approaches for quaternion interpolation using Euclidean GA rotors for skinned character animation blending. It also lays the foundation so that GA can be employed for further calculations (skinning, rendering) under a unified geometry computation framework.\",\"George Papagiannakis. 2013.

Our solution is essentially a low-code metaverse authoring platform for developers to rapidly prototype high-fidelity and high-complexity medical simulations. MAGES breaks the authoring boundaries across extended reality, since networked participants can also collaborate using different VR/AR as well as mobile and desktop devices, in the same metaverse world. With MAGES we propose an upgrade to the outdated 150-year-old masterï¿½apprentice medical training model. Our platform incorporates, in a nutshell, the following novelties: 1) 5G edge-cloud remote rendering and physics dissection layer, 2) realistic real-time simulation of organic tissues as soft-bodies under 10 ms, 3) a highly realistic cutting and tearing algorithm, 4) neural network assessment for user profiling and, 5) a VR recorder to record and replay or debrief the training simulation from any perspective'\n",
