"From low-code geometric algebra to no-code geometric 
deep learning: computational models, simulation algorithms and authoring platforms for immersive scientific visualization, experiential visual analytics and the upcoming educational metaverse",Keynote Talk,keynote-17,IEEE Virtual Reality 2023,2023-05-03,online,https://papagiannakis.github.io/files/GP-IEEEVRkeynote2023.pdf,"More than 1 billion jobs, almost one-third of all jobs worldwide, are likely to be transformed by technology in the next decade, according to OECD and World Economic Forum estimates. In addition, 5 billion people today lack access to proper surgical and anesthesia care, due to the limited number of health professionals entering the workforce, as a direct result of the lack of innovation in medical training over the last 150 years. 
This growing need for continuous upskill and reskill, becomes even more critical in the post COVID-19 pandemic era. Extended Reality (XR) together with 5G spatial computing enabling technologies can pose as the next final frontier, regarding psychomotor/cognitive training and education content creation. XR can provide the means for qualitative hands-on education (knowledge) and training (skills), using affordable technology with on-demand, immersive scientific visualization techniques coupled with personalized, experiential visual analytics. As the expectations of the upcoming educational metaverse are rising, we review in this talk fundamental analytic as well as neural geometric computational models that are powering latest low-code as well as no-code content creation tools. Geometric algebra-based graphics character animation and rendering algorithms, Entity-Component-System scenegraphs and graph neural networks are poised to make the difference in the evolution of experiential educational metaverse applications."

There and back again: From applied research to academic entrepreneurship,Invited Talk,talk-22,CYENS 2023,2023-10-12,"Larnaca, Cyprus",https://papagiannakis.github.io/files/GP-AcademicEntrepreneurship-Cypurs keynote.pdf,"Academic entrepreneurs can have a real impact on society. Science and technology are nowdays critical in our efforts to tackle the most urgent societal challenges, be it climate change, security, or public health. But we need more targeted efforts to turn academic discoveries into an everyday reality and a real product with societal impact.  Entrepreneurship requires self-conviction, skill, luck, resilience and funding (just like scientific research) but before anything else, there needs to be passion and purpose. As scientists all we can really do is ask the questions to seek answers. As Innovators we take those answers and ideas and turn them into a product. As academic entrepreneurs we are uniquely empowered to make a small dent in the universe by ""making the world a better place"" through science and science-based tools."
