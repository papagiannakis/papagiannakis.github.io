title: "VHD++ Framework: Extendible Game Engine with Reusable Components, for VR/AR R&D featuring Advanced Virtual Character Simulation Technologies"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2003-07-25-paper-conference-7
excerpt: 'This paper presents the architecture of the VHD++ real-time development framework that after several years of intensive research, design, and development effort has been released and enters its validation phase. This paper discusses the key aspects involved in architectural structure, design and practical implementation of an efficient, flexible and extendible real-time software framework based on the modern 3D game-engine design principles. This framework supports researchers and application developers with rapid, component based development of VR/AR systems featuring advanced virtual character simulation technologies. The discussion covers motivation, main concepts, survey of related work, the main functional and design requirements, design principles and key architectural elements. It concludes with the initial validation results including overview of existing VHD++ based VR/AR virtual character simulation applications'
