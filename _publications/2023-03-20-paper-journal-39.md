title: "MAGES 4.0: Accelerating the WorldÕs Transition to VR Training and Democratizing the Authoring of the Medical Metaverse"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-03-20-paper-journal-39
excerpt: 'In this work, we propose MAGES 4.0, a novel software development kit to accelerate the creation of collaborative medical training applications in virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR). Our solution is essentially a low-code metaverse authoring platform for developers to rapidly prototype high-fidelity and high-complexity medical simulations. MAGES breaks the authoring boundaries across extended reality, since networked participants can also collaborate using different VR/AR as well as mobile and desktop devices, in the same metaverse world. With MAGES we propose an upgrade to the outdated 150-year-old masterÐapprentice medical training model. Our platform incorporates, in a nutshell, the following novelties: 1) 5G edge-cloud remote rendering and physics dissection layer, 2) realistic real-time simulation of organic tissues as soft-bodies under 10 ms, 3) a highly realistic cutting and tearing algorithm, 4) neural network assessment for user profiling and, 5) a VR recorder to record and replay or debrief the training simulation from any perspective'
