XR can provide the means for qualitative hands-on education (knowledge) and training (skills), using affordable technology with on-demand, immersive scientific visualization techniques coupled with personalized, experiential visual analytics. As the expectations of the upcoming educational metaverse are rising, we review in this talk fundamental analytic as well as neural geometric computational models that are powering latest low-code as well as no-code XR content creation tools. Geometric algebra-based graphics character animation and rendering algorithms, Entity-Component-System scenegraphs and graph neural networks are poised to make the difference as experiential medical metaverse 2.0 enabling technologies.
