Computational medical XR brings together life sciences and neuroscience with mathematics, engineering, and computer science. It unifies computational science (scientific computing) with intelligent extended reality and spatial computing for the medical field. It significantly extends previous &apos;Clinical XR&apos;, by integrating computational methods from neural simulation to computational geometry, computational vision and computer graphics up to theoretical computer science and deep learning to solve hard problems in medicine and neuroscience: from low-code/no-code generative AI authoring medical XR platforms to deep learning systems for diagnostics, therapeutics, rehabilitation and from surgical planning to real-time operative navigation in XR. 
In this workshop we present the most recent advances in the field of Generative AI with applications in the computational medical XR training and education field.
